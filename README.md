# HappyButtonClicker
A small test project, showcasing how to use puppeteer to automate some webpages. 

I've set up this project to automate some contest including some quiz to win some prices hosted on a website running Ember. Might be helpful for other websites. Do not ask me about the strange order of elements to be clicked, they were specified by the website i've used them on.

Please note, that this was built as a fun project, isn't cleaned up and done quick and dirty - _but_ it gets the job done.

## Prerequisites:

* .NET 5.0
* Chrome being installed
